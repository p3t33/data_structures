# Data structures

This repository contains several implementations (in c and c++) of common data structures, each one has a folder and an API. All data structures were tested and preform as expected to the best of my knowledge, if you encounter a bug please let me know. 

All stable and tested code is located on the master branch and all unfinished / untested code is located on the development branch.

## Compilers and operating system
* Development was on ubuntu 18.04 LTS OS.
* Source code was compiled with:
    - for C - GNU gcc (v7.4) and clang (v6.0), std=99
    - for C++ - GNU g++ (v7.4) and clang++ (v6.0), std=11
* Tested for memory leaks using Valgrind v3.13.0
